distance from scat to closest track:

select scat_id,
(select concat(snowtrack_id, '|', ROUND(st_distance(s.geometry_utm, multilines))) FROM snow_tracks
   where st_distance(s.geometry_utm, multilines) = (select min(st_distance(s.geometry_utm, multilines)) from snow_tracks) LIMIT 1) AS track_dist
from scats s where sampling_type = 'Systematic';


replace province name by province code:

update transects set province=(select province_code from geo_info where province_name=transects.province) WHERE province in (select province_name from geo_info);
